## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Splash Screen **: Used a `Handler` to introduce a delay, ensuring the app loads seamlessly before transitioning to the main screen.

- *Onboarding Screen*:  Implemented an onboarding experience using `ViewPager`, creating smooth, swipeable pages that highlight key features of the app for new users.

- *SharedPreferences*: To ensure the `onboarding screen` only appears on the first visit, leveraged `SharedPreferences`. After the user completes the onboarding process, a boolean flag is saved, making it easy to check on subsequent launches whether to skip the onboarding.

- *Custom DatePicker*: Built a fully customizable `DatePicker` using a `Fragment`. This approach provided users with a smooth and intuitive experience when selecting dates.

- *Field Validation*:  Implemented a `validation` check to ensure that essential fields are not left empty before allowing the user to create a task.

- *SQLite Database*: By leveraging `SQLit`e, Implemented essential `CRUD` operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage data within the app, ensuring smooth performance even with large datasets.

- *Foreground Service*: Implemented a 1Foreground Service1 to monitor task time and trigger 1notifications` when a task starts. This service runs continuously in the background, ensuring time tracking remains active even if the app is not in the foreground.
